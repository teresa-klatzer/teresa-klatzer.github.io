### Women in Maths and Machine Learning
- I am a member of the <a href="https://piscopia.co.uk/">Piscopia initiative </a> that is about encouraging women and non-binary students to pursue a PhD in Mathematics and creating a support network for students and researchers in Mathematics and related disciplines.
- The organization <a href="https://www.wiml.org/"> Women in Machine Learning (WiML) </a> offers great opportunities and support to women in the field. Check out their mailing list and events (I am attending the WiML Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024 this year!)
- <a href="https://hermathsstory.eu/">Her Maths Story</a> is a beautiful project all about sharing stories of other women in mathematics, depicting the endless possibilities and life trajectories a career in mathematics can entail.
- Athene Donald wrote this inspiring book: <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/not-just-for-the-boys-9780192893406?cc=gb&lang=en&"> Not Just for the Boys.
Why We Need More Women in Science</a>. An inspiring and truly helpful book to understand the unique challenges of being part of a minority group in science, about the fascinations of science careers and to find empowerment.
- <a href="https://www.pictureascientist.com/"> Picture a scientist</a> is a compelling documentary about women scientists. Uncomfortable and empowering.

### Outreach
- I was very happy to present a stand-up comedy piece on ‚ÄúMy life with inverse problems‚Äù as part of the Mathematics Showdown within the Edinburgh Science Festival in April 2023. 5 Mathematicians went on the challenge to explain their PhD topics to a general audience. Find a recording of my contribution on <a href="https://youtu.be/3X-fzkVcJyk"> Youtube </a> ü§ì



### Implicit bias
- How <a href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/article/iat/">implicit bias </a> affects even us women in science. Everyone seems biased against women leaders - uncovered by the implicit association test.

### Reading list
- One of my favourite german-writing feminist authors is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emiliazenzile/">Emilia Roig</a>. I recommend <a href="https://www.ullstein.de/werke/das-ende-der-ehe/hardcover/9783550202285">"Das Ende der Ehe"</a>. She speaks about her views on love in this <a href="https://chezmamapoule.com/emilia-roig-liebe/">podcast</a>.
- Also in german: This collection of essays called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61379879-unlearn-patriarchy">"Unlearn Patriarchy"</a> meanwhile has a second edition.
- Some classics by bell hooks: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17607.All_About_Love">All about love</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32886.Communion">Communion</a>, and <a href="https://bellhooksbooks.com/product/the-will-to-change/">The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love</a>. 
- Thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fraeulein_tessa/">Teresa Buecker</a> for pointing out this text by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ntzxq0e9yT1_Ni5KBdyIiByIVfhavIW_/view?usp=sharing">Bell Hooks on the nature of work</a>
