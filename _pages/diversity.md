### women in maths
- I am a member of the <a href="https://piscopia.co.uk/">Piscopia initiative </a> that is about encouraging women and non-binary students to pursue a PhD in Mathematics and creating a support network for students and researchers in Mathematics and related disciplines.
- <a href="https://hermathsstory.eu/">Her Maths Story</a> is a beautiful project all about sharing stories of other women in mathematics, depicting the endless possibilities and life trajectories a career in mathematics can entail.
- Athene Donald wrote this inspiring book: <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/not-just-for-the-boys-9780192893406?cc=gb&lang=en&"> Not Just for the Boys.
Why We Need More Women in Science</a>. An inspiring and truly helpful book to understand the unique challenges of being part of a minority group in science, about the fascinations of science careers and to find empowerment.
- <a href="https://www.pictureascientist.com/"> Picture a scientist</a> is a compelling documentary about women scientists. Uncomfortable and empowering.

### implicit bias
- How <a href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/article/iat/">implicit bias </a> affects even us women in science. Everyone seems biased against women leaders - uncovered by the implicit association test.
