Since 2021, I am working on my PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics on Bayesian computation for imaging science. My supervisors are <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~kzygalak/">Konstantinos Zygalakis</a>, <a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mp71/about.html">Marcelo Pereyra</a> and <a href="https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/yoann-altmann">Yoann Altmann</a> and I am currently affiliated with the <a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mp71/bloom.html">BLOOM</a> project. A list of publications can be found <a href="https://teresa-klatzer.github.io/publications/">here</a> or on my <a href='https://scholar.google.at/citations?hl=de&user=9NuwsCgAAAAJ'> Google Scholar profile</a>. My published codes can be found <a href="https://teresa-klatzer.github.io/repositories/">here</a>.

My current **research interests** are at the intersection of Bayesian computation, numerical analysis, inverse problems, and machine learning. I am interested in the mathematical foundations of algorithms and methodology to solve problems in the field of imaging science.

Before joining the project BLOOM, I have been working as a software project manager, product owner and agile coach. I have obtained a professional certification in coaching and counselling in Graz, Austria. I am happy to **offer mentoring** in mental health topics around science and non-normative walks in life. See my <a href="https://teresa-klatzer.github.io/publications/">diversity</a> section for more resources.

I have received a MSc in Information and Computer Engineering (Telematics) in 2014 from Graz University of Technology on the topic of "Bi-level Optimization for Support Vector Machines". Between 2014-2017, I have been working as a research assistant at the Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision in the group of <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-pock">Thomas Pock</a>, working on the project "Deep variational networks for low-level computer vision". My research topics included the development of machine learning and optimization methods for applications in low-level image processing and computational photography.
