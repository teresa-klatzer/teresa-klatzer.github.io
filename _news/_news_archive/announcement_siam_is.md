I am attending <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/past-event-archive/is24/"> SIAM Imaging </a> Atlanta from 28-31 May 2024! My talk was part of the <a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=79047"> mini-symposium </a> "Deep Unrolled Methods for Inverse Imaging Problems" and I am looking forward to speaking about my latest research and meeting you there!
