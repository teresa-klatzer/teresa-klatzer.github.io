I am excited to announce that my latest paper <b> Efficient Bayesian Computation Using Plug-and-Play Priors for Poisson Inverse Problems </b> has been accepted for publication in the SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences! The latest preprint is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16222">arXiv</a>! 🎉✨
