I am presenting a poster on <b> Bayesian Computation with Plug-and-Play Priors for Poisson Inverse Problems</b> at the <a href="https://www.icms.org.uk/InverseProblems">ICMS workshop </a> on "Imaging inverse problems and generating models: sparsity and robustness versus expressivity" and enjoying the talks and discussions!
