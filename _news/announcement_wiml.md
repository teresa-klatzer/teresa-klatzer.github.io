I am excited to attend <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2024">NeurIPS 2024</a> in Vancouver, Canada (Dec 10-15) this year! I will present a contributed talk (I am honoured to be 1 out of 4 select presenters!) and a poster about my work at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wiml-2024/home">WiML Workshop</a>. Thanks to the sponsors for the full travel grant! I am presenting my work on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-hyDHCmaVYhRiJAVWOozEKKxihwtn0BY/view?usp=sharing">"Mirror Langevin Dynamics with Plug-and-Play Priors for Poisson Inverse Problems"</a>.
